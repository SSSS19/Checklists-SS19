# Checklists-SS19

This app was created with the help of the good folks at RayWenderlich.com and their great book iOS Apprentice. 

The To-Do list app usually regarded as a 'rite of passage' for iOS developers so was a great experience developing this app.

'The app lets you organize to-do items into lists and then check off these items once 
you’re done with them. You can also set a reminder on a to-do item that will make
the iPhone pop up an alert on the due date, even when the app isn’t running.
As far as to-do list apps go, Checklists is very basic, but don’t let that fool you. 
Even a simple app such as this already has five different screens and a lot of complexity behind the scenes.'
